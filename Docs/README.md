## **Overview**

**Description:**  
*Prefab Palette is a self contained Unity Editor tool designed to simplify prefab placement in your scenes. Tired of manually dragging and dropping prefabs into the scene, I built this tool that lets you organise prefabs into collections, choose between different placement modes, and just click in the Scene View to place them.*

⚠️ Note: No prefabs are included with this project! Example assets are from [Raygeas: Grasslands - Stylized Nature](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/environments/fantasy/grasslands-stylized-nature-287353).

**Unity Compatibility:** Unity 2021.2+

## **Core Features**

* **Prefab Collections**:
  Organise assets into custom collections via the *Collections Manager* or directly from the Project Window’s right-click context menu.

* **Palette Window**:
  A dockable browser to visualise and select prefabs quickly through their thumbnails.

* **Scene View Overlay**:
  Manage placement settings and toggle *Placement Modes* without leaving the Scene View.

* **Visual Placer**:
  A dynamic target reticle follows your cursor, providing real-time feedback on exactly where and how your prefab will land.
    
* **Placement Modes**:
  Switch between specialised placement behaviors, each with unique logic and settings.

* **Fully Configurable**:
  Fine-tune your workflow in the *Tool Settings* window. Adjust UI scale, reticle colors, physics layers, and more.

* **Native Integration**:
  Seamlessly supports Unity’s native *Undo/Redo* system and standard *Snap Controls*.

* **Extensible Architecture**:
  Built on a modular, state-based design. Implement custom placement logic by following the [Developer Guide](./_NoShip/Developers.md#creating-new-mode).

## **Installation**

1. Download the latest package from the **Releases** section of the repo.

2. Drag and drop the package into the project window of a unity project.

3. Follow the dialog to import package contents.

4. The prefab palette folder is self-contained, so it can be moved anywhere within the project without breaking, providing its internal integrity is maintained.

---

## **Quick Start**
Follow this guide to start using the tool straight away.

### **Create a Collection**
1. In the project view, navigate to your prefab folder/s.  
2. Right click on the folder or selected prefab/s you want in the collection.  
3. Select `Create Prefab Collection` from the context menu.  
4. Enter a name for your collection in the dialog box.  
5. Press Create.  
6. After the domain reload, a dialog box will confirm collection creation.

### **Open the Palette**
![Palette Window img](imgs/PaletteWindow.png)

The palette can be opened through either:
1. The options overlay.
2. Unity Editor Toolbar: `Window > Prefab Palette > Palette`

### Choose Mode
1. Open the tools overlay by either:
 * between Unity version **2021.2** & **2022.3**: Overlays are hidden by default. Use the *backtick* key to open the overlay menu, and choose `Prefab Palette: Options` from the list.
 * Unity version **2023.1+**: Open with the overlay toolbar icon ![Overlay Icon](imgs/OverlayToolbarIcon.png) 

2. Choose the desired mode and settings from the Options Overlay in the scene view:  
   ![Scene View Overlay](imgs/Overlay.png) 

### **Start Placing Prefabs**
1. Select the collection from the enum dropdown at the top of the palette window:  
2. Select a prefab by clicking its thumbnail:  
   ![Palette Selected](imgs/PaletteSelected.png)   
3. A target reticle will appear in the scene view and follow the mouse.  
4. Click to place a prefab in the scene.

## **Overlay** 
The overlay is used to toggle common settings, switch between modes, and adjust mode specific options from the scene view. Its size can be customised via the tool settings window.

### How to open
Unity Version:
 * **2021.2** <--> **2022.3**: Overlays are hidden by default. Use the *backtick* key to open the overlay menu, and choose `Prefab Palette: Options` from the list.
 * **2023.1+**: Open with the overlay toolbar icon ![Overlay Icon](imgs/OverlayToolbarIcon.png) 

### Resizing the overlay
See the *Overlay* options in the [Tool Settings & Customisation](#tool-settings--customisation) section.

## **Modes**
### **Global Mode Options**
These options are available across all placement modes.

| *Option* | *Effect* |
| :---- | :---- |
| **Align with surface?** | Align the prefabs rotation with the normal of the surface it’s placed on. |

### **Single**
Click to place a single selected prefab instance.

**Overlay Options**
| *Option* | *Type* | *Effect* |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Rotation Speed** | Slider | Changes how fast the object rotates. |
| **Placement Offset** | Vector 3 Field | Positions the object with an offset relative to the click position. |
| **Align With Surface?** | Toggle | Rotates the object to match the angle (normal) of the surface clicked on. |

### **Line**
Use this mode to draw a line of prefabs and control how the line renders with the overlay options. Useful for fences and walls etc. 

**Overlay Options**
| *Option* | *Type* | *Effect* |
| ----- | :---- | :---- |

| **Range**  | Min/Max Slider | Defines the constrained range of rotation per axis. |
| **Axis** | Vector 3 Toggle | Enables/disables random rotation per axis. |
| **Chain Lines?** | Toggle | Starts the next line from the end of the previous one, allowing continuous placement. |
| **Link Offset** | Vector 3 Field | Adds an offset to the start position of the chained line relative to the previous line's endpoint. |

## **FAQ**
**Q: Can't find overlay?**  
 A: Make sure the tool is imported correctly by ensuring the  `Window` toolbar menu has an option for `Prefab Palette`.
 If you're using Unity version: 
 
 * between **2021.2** & **2022.3**: Overlays are hidden by default. Use the *backtick* key to open the overlay menu, and choose `Prefab Palette: Options` from the list.

 * **2023.1+**: Open with the overlay toolbar icon ![Overlay Icon](imgs/OverlayToolbarIcon.png) 

**Q: The tool doesn't show up in the Unity `Window` toolbar menu?**  
 A: Make sure the tool is imported from the Unity Package correctly, all scripts are present, and you’re using a compatible Unity version.

**Q: Objects aren’t placed correctly?**  
 A: Check if your prefab has a root transform offset or collider.

 **Q: Objects are glitching or stacking as they're being placed?**  
 A: Check `ToolSettings > Placer > Include Layers` and deselect the physics layer your prefab is on. 

**Q: Can I use this with terrain?**  
 A: Yes, the tool supports placement on Unity Terrain.

**Q: Why can’t the tool be installed via Unity Package Manager?**  
 A: The tool relies on an enum generated at runtime to populate dropdowns with available collections. UPM expects packages to remain unchanged, so generating files at runtime isn’t possible. Since the generated enum needs to reside within the package's assembly definition to be accessible by dependent code, this restriction makes UPM unsuitable for distributing this tool. Working around this constraint would introduce significant complexity.
